Formerly known as meteor2twitter at GitLab.

v 0.3.0

## Overview

This is a Meteor app that allows users to add a blog feed listing via a web interface, stores them in a Mongo database, and tweets when a new feed is added or a new post is published.

It loops every 10 minutes, and only announces one new feed each cycle, to avoid triggering Twitterâ€™s spam blockers.

## New in v 0.3.0
* Now archives new posts and their tags each cycle
* Shows running total of blogs, posts and tags on home screen
* Shows latest 10 posts on initial 'browse/search' screen
* Browse by tag
* Search with EasySearch - indexes blog URL and post title, author and tags/categories
* Cleaned up code to make it a bit easier to read

## New in v 0.2.2
* fixed major bug in approving pending listings
* discovered why unit testing is a good idea
